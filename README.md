# flask_notes

A running demo is viewable here https://saundersnotes.herokuapp.com/

I built this to practice Python-Flask.

The app runs on an SQLite3 database. It will reset after 24 hours and delete data. 

A user can create an account and is taken to a personalised notes page.

The site is hosted on Heroku free tier so takes time for the server to wake up.
